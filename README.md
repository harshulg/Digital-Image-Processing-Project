# Digital-Image-Processing-Project
In this project, we implemented a simple image prior—dark channel prior to remove  haze from a input image. The dark channel prior is a kind of statistical model of  outdoor haze-free images. It is based on a key observation—most local patches in  outdoor haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least  one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly  estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image.  Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior.  Moreover, a high-quality depth map can also be obtained as a byproduct of haze  removal.
